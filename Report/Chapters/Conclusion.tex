\chapter{Conclusion}
The project started with problems, since the data collected from driving a car was a lot different than data got by driving a RC-Car. The project had to adapt and focus on important objectives.

Data analysis and modification made it possible to reach a degree of reliability, that was not expected this high, since real world data is far from perfect and accidents happen, especially while racing.

The project has great further potential to be more robust, more precise and give better tips. By taking the remaining acceleration axis into account, the range of the tips could be increased as well as the section identification could be done even more robust by looking at more data. Another possible addition would be a neural network fed with training data to recognise racing patterns. Even real-time section identification could be possible that way.
