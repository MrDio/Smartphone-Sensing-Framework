\section{Section Identification}
The following section will describe the solution for the identification of sections. And is split into two parts. The first explains the rough identification of sections. These sections will then be given to a classification method that clearly identifies the type of section, be it a curve or a straight line. 

\subsection{Identification}
The identification is split into three parts that will be executed serial. After smoothing and filtering of the dataset. The x-axis acceleration values will be split into two groups. These split is happening with a singular x value representing a threshold.  

\subsection{Classification}
