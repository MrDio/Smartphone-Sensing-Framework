\section{Use Cases}
The application LapOps has two use cases: recording racing performance and reviewing previous reports. Figure \ref{fig:usecase} shows the use cases. The first use case, recording racing performance, implements the main part of the application, which is extended by the generation of reports. In the second use case the generated reports can be reviewed.
